// /// For this challenge I wanted to print only the names that have 4 characters or less.
// 1) I will be forming an array which allows me to store many pieces of data in one variable. 
// 2) The friendsNames variable stores an array of strings. 
// 3) To start I'm going to name my variable by typing, var friendsNames =, after that i'll type the array in [], and that will be where my array of 
// strings will live. 
// 4) Next I'll be using a for statement to tell print as much material as I command until the end point I've commanded. This will start with the word for
// then (var i =0; i < friendsNames.length; i++) this is declaring that the variable with print the array of names indefinitely
// 5) then by typing if(friendsNames[i].length <= 4) I can print just the names of friends with four letter names or less. by having the [i] placed within 
// the friendsNames.length it will narrow the command down to the i(item.)
// 6)now I want to make sure I have all of my curly brackets in the right places. the open curly bracket after the for will start the command. and the open 
// curly bracket after the if statment will start the next command. Then we will used two closed brackets after the console.log wich will close my code block. 
// 7) before I close my curly brackets I'll write my console log which will include the variable and the item I want it to print. Everything has been defined 
// above the console log so everything should print correctly.
